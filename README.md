# Word-Segmentation-Method-of-Ancient-Chinese
This project is a word segmentation method based on word alignment (WSWA). Specifically, the method segments words according to the word 
alignment between modern Chinese words and ancient Chinese characters. If multiple consecutive characters in ancient Chinese align to 
the same modern Chinese word, they are considered as one word.
